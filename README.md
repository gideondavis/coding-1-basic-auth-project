# Coding I - Encryption and Authentication Project

**Due date:** 3/6

When you finish, add your names and a demo video link here, then submit one link to your project repository.

**Group Members:** (list all group members here)
* [Demo Video (1 per group)](http://includeyourlinkhere)

In this project, you will design and build a **login system web application** in Python using Flask. This project is broken into four major phases, each of which will teach a critical part of building a secure application.

## Project Requirements:

| Phase I: Build Login & Registration Structure (15 pts) |
|----------|
* Create a basic Flask app with a login page and registration page.
* Include fields for username and password.
* Display a message for successful login and an error for incorrect login attempts.
* Add navigation between login and registration pages.
* Confirm that basic functionality works before moving to the next phase.

| Phase II: Store Passwords in a Database (15 pts) |
|----------|
* Set up an SQLite database to persist user data.
* Store username and password fields in the database.
* Ensure that user data remains intact even when the app is restarted.
* Verify that registration adds users correctly and login checks the database.

| Phase III: Encrypt Passwords with Bcrypt (20 pts) |
|----------|
* Install and use bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
* Update the login logic to verify passwords against the hashed values.
* Ensure that passwords are never stored in plain text.
* Test that registration and login work correctly for multiple users.

| Phase IV: Require Password Complexity (20 pts) |
|----------|
* Implement password validation rules:
  - At least 1 uppercase letter
  - At least 1 lowercase letter
  - At least 1 number
  - At least 1 special character
* Display a clear error message if the password does not meet the requirements.
* Ensure that registration only succeeds if the password meets the rules.
* Test the validation thoroughly with multiple password examples.

| Phase V: Reflection + Demo Video (20 pts) |
|----------|
* Record a screen-share of another student testing your login system.
* Show a screen-share of your code and explain how each phase was implemented.
* Describe at least 3 portions of your code that you are most proud of.
* Both group members should speak during the video.

| Optional Bonus (+10 pts / each) |
|----------|
* Add a “secret page” that displays the user’s name after login.
* Style the pages with CSS to improve the user interface.
* Implement a “Reset Database” button for easy testing.
* Add additional security features (e.g., session timeouts, email verification).
